# Focus Flow ‚åõ - Pomodoro App

## üß† What was the hardest part to build? How did you approach it?

The hardest part was getting the **timer and task management to work together smoothly**. I had to make sure the timer switched correctly between work and break sessions, and also kept track of which task was active and how many Pomodoro sessions it had completed.

There were a few tricky situations, like:
- How to pick the next task automatically?
- Making sure the timer doesn‚Äôt start when there are no tasks or all tasks are done.

### How I solved it:
- Used `useEffect` with a `setInterval` to handle the countdown logic.
- On timer end, it switches between work and break sessions.
- Created a function to update task progress and mark it as completed.
- If the current task is completed, it automatically picks the next incomplete task.
- Added checks to prevent starting the timer when no tasks are available.
- Implemented a basic focus tracker that reduces score on pause events.

By breaking down the logic step-by-step and testing edge cases, I kept everything in sync and avoided bugs.

## ‚öñÔ∏è What tradeoffs did you make and why?

I decided to **keep everything in one big component** instead of splitting it into smaller ones. This made the code a bit messier, but it helped me move faster and stay focused on getting features to work first. For a real app, I would break it up later.

## ‚è± If you had 2 more hours, what would you improve?

1. **Split the UI into smaller components** ‚Äì like `TaskList`, `Timer`, and `FocusMetrics` for better structure.
2. **Save tasks and sessions** using LocalStorage so users don‚Äôt lose their progress when they refresh the page.
3. **Add a settings panel** to let users customize timer lengths and break durations.
4. **Polish the UI** ‚Äì smoother animations, light/dark theme toggle.
5. **Show Pomodoro history** ‚Äì a simple list or chart showing completed sessions over time.

## ü§ñ Did you use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How and why?

Yes, I used **ChatGPT** during development to:
- Write the basic layout and structure of the app
- Help break down the timer and state logic
- Plan extra features like focus scoring and skip break
- Write this reflection at the end

AI helped me move faster by taking care of repetitive or confusing parts so I could focus on building the core features. I still made all the final decisions on structure, logic, and UX myself.

## üß≠ What decisions did you make beyond the suggestions?

- I added a **Focus Score and Distraction Counter** to track how focused a user was during a session.
- I used **Tailwind CSS** for fast, responsive styling with a clean look.
- I included a **"Skip Break" button** so users can jump back into work without waiting.
